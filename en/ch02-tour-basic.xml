    <title>Getting started</title>

    <para id="x_e">To begin, we'll use the <command role="hg-cmd">hg
	version</command> command to find out whether Mercurial is
      installed properly.  The actual version information that it
      prints isn't so important; we simply care whether the command
      runs and prints anything at all.</para>

    &interaction.tour.version;

    <sect2>
      <title>Built-in help</title>

      <para id="x_f">Mercurial provides a built-in help system.  This is
	  invaluable for those times when you find yourself stuck
	  trying to remember how to run a command.  If you are
	  completely stuck, simply run <command role="hg-cmd">hg
	    help</command>; it will print a brief list of commands,
	  along with a description of what each does.  If you ask for
	  help on a specific command (as below), it prints more
	  detailed information.</para>

	&interaction.tour.help;

	<para id="x_10">For a more impressive level of detail (which you won't
	  usually need) run <command role="hg-cmd">hg help <option
	      role="hg-opt-global">-v</option></command>.  The <option
	    role="hg-opt-global">-v</option> option is short for
	  <option role="hg-opt-global">--verbose</option>, and tells
	  Mercurial to print more information than it usually
	  would.</para>

    </sect2>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>Working with a repository</title>

    <para id="x_11">In Mercurial, everything happens inside a
      <emphasis>repository</emphasis>.  The repository for a project
      contains all of the files that <quote>belong to</quote> that
      project, along with a historical record of the project's
      files.</para>

    <para id="x_12">There's nothing particularly magical about a repository; it
      is simply a directory tree in your filesystem that Mercurial
      treats as special. You can rename or delete a repository any
      time you like, using either the command line or your file
      browser.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Making a local copy of a repository</title>

      <para id="x_13"><emphasis>Copying</emphasis> a repository is just a little
	bit special.  While you could use a normal file copying
	command to make a copy of a repository, it's best to use a
	built-in command that Mercurial provides.  This command is
	called <command role="hg-cmd">hg clone</command>, because it
	makes an identical copy of an existing repository.</para>

      &interaction.tour.clone;

      <para id="x_67c">One advantage of using <command role="hg-cmd">hg
	  clone</command> is that, as we can see above, it lets us clone
	repositories over the network.  Another is that it remembers
	where we cloned from, which we'll find useful soon when we
	want to fetch new changes from another repository.</para>

      <para id="x_14">If our clone succeeded, we should now have a local
	directory called <filename class="directory">hello</filename>.
	This directory will contain some files.</para>

      &interaction.tour.ls;

      <para id="x_15">These files have the same contents and history in our
	repository as they do in the repository we cloned.</para>

      <para id="x_16">Every Mercurial repository is complete,
	self-contained, and independent.  It contains its own private
	copy of a project's files and history.  As we just mentioned,
	a cloned repository remembers the location of the repository
	it was cloned from, but Mercurial will not communicate with
	that repository, or any other, unless you tell it to.</para>

      <para id="x_17">What this means for now is that we're free to experiment
	with our repository, safe in the knowledge that it's a private
	<quote>sandbox</quote> that won't affect anyone else.</para>

    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>What's in a repository?</title>

      <para id="x_18">When we take a more detailed look inside a repository, we
	can see that it contains a directory named <filename
	  class="directory">.hg</filename>.  This is where Mercurial
	keeps all of its metadata for the repository.</para>

      &interaction.tour.ls-a;

      <para id="x_19">The contents of the <filename
	  class="directory">.hg</filename> directory and its
	subdirectories are private to Mercurial.  Every other file and
	directory in the repository is yours to do with as you
	please.</para>

      <para id="x_1a">To introduce a little terminology, the <filename
	  class="directory">.hg</filename> directory is the
	<quote>real</quote> repository, and all of the files and
	directories that coexist with it are said to live in the
	<emphasis>working directory</emphasis>.  An easy way to
	remember the distinction is that the
	<emphasis>repository</emphasis> contains the
	<emphasis>history</emphasis> of your project, while the
	<emphasis>working directory</emphasis> contains a
	<emphasis>snapshot</emphasis> of your project at a particular
	point in history.</para>

    </sect2>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>A tour through history</title>

    <para id="x_1b">One of the first things we might want to do with a new,
      unfamiliar repository is understand its history.  The <command
	role="hg-cmd">hg log</command> command gives us a view of
      the history of changes in the repository.</para>

    &interaction.tour.log;

    <para id="x_1c">By default, this command prints a brief paragraph of output
      for each change to the project that was recorded.  In Mercurial
      terminology, we call each of these recorded events a
      <emphasis>changeset</emphasis>, because it can contain a record
      of changes to several files.</para>

    <para id="x_1d">The fields in a record of output from <command
	role="hg-cmd">hg log</command> are as follows.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para id="x_1e"><literal>changeset</literal>: This
	  field has the format of a number, followed by a colon,
	  followed by a hexadecimal (or <emphasis>hex</emphasis>)
	  string.  These are <emphasis>identifiers</emphasis> for the
	  changeset.  The hex string is a unique identifier: the same
	  hex string will always refer to the same changeset in every
	  copy of this repository. The
	  number is shorter and easier to type than the hex string,
	  but it isn't unique: the same number in two different clones
	  of a repository may identify different changesets.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para id="x_1f"><literal>user</literal>: The identity of the
	  person who created the changeset.  This is a free-form
	  field, but it most often contains a person's name and email
	  address.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para id="x_20"><literal>date</literal>: The date and time on
	  which the changeset was created, and the timezone in which
	  it was created.  (The date and time are local to that
	  timezone; they display what time and date it was for the
	  person who created the changeset.)</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para id="x_21"><literal>summary</literal>: The first line of
	  the text message that the creator of the changeset entered
	  to describe the changeset.</para></listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para id="x_67d">Some changesets, such as the first in the list above,
	  have a <literal>tag</literal> field.  A tag is another way
	  to identify a changeset, by giving it an easy-to-remember
	  name. (The tag named <literal>tip</literal> is special: it
	  always refers to the newest change in a repository.)</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para id="x_22">The default output printed by <command
	role="hg-cmd">hg log</command> is purely a summary; it is
      missing a lot of detail.</para>

    <para id="x_23"><xref linkend="fig:tour-basic:history"/> provides
      a graphical representation of the history of the <filename

      <title>Changesets, revisions, and talking to other
	people</title>

      <para id="x_25">As English is a notoriously sloppy language, and computer
	science has a hallowed history of terminological confusion
	(why use one term when four will do?), revision control has a
	variety of words and phrases that mean the same thing.  If you
	are talking about Mercurial history with other people, you
	will find that the word <quote>changeset</quote> is often
	compressed to <quote>change</quote> or (when written)
	<quote>cset</quote>, and sometimes a changeset is referred to
	as a <quote>revision</quote> or a <quote>rev</quote>.</para>

      <para id="x_26">While it doesn't matter what <emphasis>word</emphasis> you
	use to refer to the concept of <quote>a changeset</quote>, the
	<emphasis>identifier</emphasis> that you use to refer to
	<quote>a <emphasis>specific</emphasis> changeset</quote> is of
	great importance. Recall that the <literal>changeset</literal>
	field in the output from <command role="hg-cmd">hg
	  log</command> identifies a changeset using both a number and
	a hexadecimal string.</para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para id="x_27">The revision number is a handy
	    notation that is <emphasis>only valid in that
	      repository</emphasis>.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para id="x_28">The hexadecimal string is the
	    <emphasis>permanent, unchanging identifier</emphasis> that
	    will always identify that exact changeset in
	    <emphasis>every</emphasis> copy of the
	    repository.</para></listitem></itemizedlist>

      <para id="x_29">This distinction is important.  If you send
	someone an email talking about <quote>revision 33</quote>,
	there's a high likelihood that their revision 33 will
	<emphasis>not be the same</emphasis> as yours.  The reason for
	this is that a revision number depends on the order in which
	changes arrived in a repository, and there is no guarantee
	that the same changes will happen in the same order in
	different repositories. Three changes <literal>a,b,c</literal>
	can easily appear in one repository as
	<literal>0,1,2</literal>, while in another as
	<literal>0,2,1</literal>.</para>

      <para id="x_2a">Mercurial uses revision numbers purely as a convenient
	shorthand.  If you need to discuss a changeset with someone,
	or make a record of a changeset for some other reason (for
	example, in a bug report), use the hexadecimal
	identifier.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Viewing specific revisions</title>

      <para id="x_2b">To narrow the output of <command role="hg-cmd">hg
	  log</command> down to a single revision, use the <option
	  role="hg-opt-log">-r</option> (or <option
	  role="hg-opt-log">--rev</option>) option.  You can use
	either a revision number or a hexadecimal identifier,
	and you can provide as many revisions as you want.</para>

      &interaction.tour.log-r;

      <para id="x_2c">If you want to see the history of several revisions
	without having to list each one, you can use <emphasis>range
	  notation</emphasis>; this lets you express the idea <quote>I
	  want all revisions between <literal>abc</literal> and
	  <literal>def</literal>, inclusive</quote>.</para>
      
	&interaction.tour.log.range;

      <para id="x_2d">Mercurial also honours the order in which you specify
	revisions, so <command role="hg-cmd">hg log -r 2:4</command>
	prints 2, 3, and 4. while <command role="hg-cmd">hg log -r
	  4:2</command> prints 4, 3, and 2.</para>

      <title>More detailed information</title>

      <para id="x_2e">While the summary information printed by <command
	  role="hg-cmd">hg log</command> is useful if you already know
	what you're looking for, you may need to see a complete
	description of the change, or a list of the files changed, if
	you're trying to decide whether a changeset is the one you're
	looking for. The <command role="hg-cmd">hg log</command>
	command's <option role="hg-opt-global">-v</option> (or <option
	  role="hg-opt-global">--verbose</option>) option gives you
	this extra detail.</para>

      &interaction.tour.log-v;

      <para id="x_2f">If you want to see both the description and
	content of a change, add the <option
	  role="hg-opt-log">-p</option> (or <option
	  role="hg-opt-log">--patch</option>) option.  This displays
	the content of a change as a <emphasis>unified diff</emphasis>
	(if you've never seen a unified diff before, see <xref
	  linkend="sec:mq:patch"/> for an overview).</para>

      &interaction.tour.log-vp;

      <para id="x_67e">The <option role="hg-opt-log">-p</option> option is

  <sect1>
    <title>All about command options</title>

    <para id="x_30">Let's take a brief break from exploring Mercurial commands
      to discuss a pattern in the way that they work; you may find
      this useful to keep in mind as we continue our tour.</para>

    <para id="x_31">Mercurial has a consistent and straightforward approach to
      dealing with the options that you can pass to commands.  It
      follows the conventions for options that are common to modern
      Linux and Unix systems.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para id="x_32">Every option has a long name.  For example, as
	  we've already seen, the <command role="hg-cmd">hg
	    log</command> command accepts a <option
	    role="hg-opt-log">--rev</option> option.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para id="x_33">Most options have short names, too.  Instead
	  of <option role="hg-opt-log">--rev</option>, we can use
	  <option role="hg-opt-log">-r</option>.  (The reason that
	  some options don't have short names is that the options in
	  question are rarely used.)</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para id="x_34">Long options start with two dashes (e.g.
	  <option role="hg-opt-log">--rev</option>), while short
	  options start with one (e.g. <option
	    role="hg-opt-log">-r</option>).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para id="x_35">Option naming and usage is consistent across
	  commands.  For example, every command that lets you specify
	  a changeset ID or revision number accepts both <option
	    role="hg-opt-log">-r</option> and <option
	    role="hg-opt-log">--rev</option> arguments.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para id="x_67f">If you are using short options, you can save typing by
	  running them together. For example, the command <command
	    role="hg-cmd">hg log -v -p -r 2</command> can be written
	  as <command role="hg-cmd">hg log -vpr2</command>.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para id="x_36">In the examples throughout this book, I usually
      use short options instead of long.  This simply reflects my own
      preference, so don't read anything significant into it.</para>

    <para id="x_37">Most commands that print output of some kind will print more
      output when passed a <option role="hg-opt-global">-v</option>
      (or <option role="hg-opt-global">--verbose</option>) option, and
      less when passed <option role="hg-opt-global">-q</option> (or
      <option role="hg-opt-global">--quiet</option>).</para>

    <note>
      <title>Option naming consistency</title>

      <para id="x_680">Almost always, Mercurial commands use consistent option
	names to refer to the same concepts.  For instance, if a
	command deals with changesets, you'll always identify them
	with <option role="hg-opt-log">--rev</option> or <option
	  role="hg-opt-log">-r</option>.  This consistent use of
	option names makes it easier to remember what options a
	particular command takes.</para>

    <title>Making and reviewing changes</title>

    <para id="x_38">Now that we have a grasp of viewing history in Mercurial,
      let's take a look at making some changes and examining
      them.</para>

    <para id="x_39">The first thing we'll do is isolate our experiment in a
      repository of its own.  We use the <command role="hg-cmd">hg
	clone</command> command, but we don't need to clone a copy of
      the remote repository.  Since we already have a copy of it
      locally, we can just clone that instead.  This is much faster
      than cloning over the network, and cloning a local repository
      uses less disk space in most cases, too<footnote>
	<para id="x_681">The saving of space arises when source and destination
	  repositories are on the same filesystem, in which case
	  Mercurial will use hardlinks to do copy-on-write sharing of
	  its internal metadata.  If that explanation meant nothing to
	  you, don't worry: everything happens transparently and
	  automatically, and you don't need to understand it.</para>
	</footnote>.</para>

    &interaction.tour.reclone;

    <para id="x_3a">As an aside, it's often good practice to keep a
      <quote>pristine</quote> copy of a remote repository around,
      which you can then make temporary clones of to create sandboxes
      for each task you want to work on.  This lets you work on
      multiple tasks in parallel, each isolated from the others until
      it's complete and you're ready to integrate it back.  Because
      local clones are so cheap, there's almost no overhead to cloning
      and destroying repositories whenever you want.</para>

    <para id="x_3b">In our <filename class="directory">my-hello</filename>
      repository, we have a file <filename>hello.c</filename> that
      contains the classic <quote>hello, world</quote> program.</para>

    <para id="x_3c">Mercurial's <command role="hg-cmd">hg status</command>
      command will tell us what Mercurial knows about the files in the
      repository.</para>

    &interaction.tour.status;

    <para id="x_3d">The <command role="hg-cmd">hg status</command> command
      prints no output for some files, but a line starting with
      <quote><literal>M</literal></quote> for
      <filename>hello.c</filename>.  Unless you tell it to, <command
	role="hg-cmd">hg status</command> will not print any output
      for files that have not been modified.</para>

    <para id="x_3e">The <quote><literal>M</literal></quote> indicates that
      Mercurial has noticed that we modified
      <filename>hello.c</filename>.  We didn't need to
      <emphasis>inform</emphasis> Mercurial that we were going to
      modify the file before we started, or that we had modified the
      file after we were done; it was able to figure this out
      itself.</para>

    <para id="x_3f">It's somewhat helpful to know that we've modified

	<command role="hg-cmd">hg pull</command> command
	<emphasis>would</emphasis> pull into the repository, without
	actually pulling the changes in.</para>

      &interaction.tour.incoming;

	repository, but if we check, there's no sign of those changes

	the working directory.  Instead, we use the <command

	this: you can use <command role="hg-cmd">hg update</command>
	to update the working directory to the state it was in at
	<emphasis>any revision</emphasis> in the history of the
	repository.  If you had the working directory updated to an
	old revision&emdash;to hunt down the origin of a bug,
