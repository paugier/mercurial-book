hg qinit [-c]

init a new queue repository

    The queue repository is unversioned by default. If -c is
    specified, qinit will create a separate nested repository
    for patches (qinit -c may also be run later to convert
    an unversioned patch repository into a versioned one).
    You can use qcommit to commit changes to this queue repository.

options:

 -c --create-repo  create queue repository

use "hg -v help qinit" to show global options
