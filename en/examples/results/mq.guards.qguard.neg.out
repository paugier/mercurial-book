hg qguard [-l] [-n] -- [PATCH] [+GUARD]... [-GUARD]...

set or print guards for a patch

    Guards control whether a patch can be pushed. A patch with no
    guards is always pushed. A patch with a positive guard ("+foo") is
    pushed only if the qselect command has activated it. A patch with
    a negative guard ("-foo") is never pushed if the qselect command
    has activated it.

    With no arguments, print the currently active guards.
    With arguments, set guards for the named patch.
    NOTE: Specifying negative guards now requires '--'.

    To set guards on another patch:
      hg qguard -- other.patch +2.6.17 -stable

options:

 -l --list  list all patches and guards
 -n --none  drop all guards

use "hg -v help qguard" to show global options
