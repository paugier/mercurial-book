			We, the Hgbook team, want to bring the book up-to-date and explain new concepts and features
			that have been added to Mercurial in the past few years.
			Some of the topics that have already been added are:
			<ul>
				<li>Customizing the output of Mercurial through the use of <b>templates</b></li>
				<li>Changing history using <b>amend</b>, <b>rebase</b> and <b>histedit</b></li>
				<li>Scaling Mercurial for large repositories and user bases</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
