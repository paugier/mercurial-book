    <title>Technical storytelling</title>

    <para id="x_72e">A few years ago, when I wanted to explain why I believed
      that distributed revision control is important, the field was
      then so new that there was almost no published literature to
      refer people to.</para>

    <para id="x_72f">Although at that time I spent some time working on the
      internals of Mercurial itself, I switched to writing this book
      because that seemed like the most effective way to help the
      software to reach a wide audience, along with the idea that
      revision control ought to be distributed in nature.  I publish
      the book online under a liberal license for the same
      reason: to get the word out.</para>

    <para id="x_730">There's a familiar rhythm to a good software book that
      closely resembles telling a story: What is this thing?  Why does
      it matter?  How will it help me?  How do I use it?  In this
      book, I try to answer those questions for distributed revision
      control in general, and for Mercurial in particular.</para>

    <title>Thank you for supporting Mercurial</title>

    <para id="x_731">By purchasing a copy of this book, you are supporting the
      continued development and freedom of Mercurial in particular,
      and of open source and free software in general. O'Reilly Media
      and I are donating my royalties on the sales of this book to the
      Software Freedom Conservancy (<ulink
	url="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/">http://www.softwarefreedom.org/</ulink>) 
      which provides clerical and legal support to Mercurial and a
      number of other prominent and worthy open source software
      projects.</para>

    <title>Acknowledgments</title>

    <para id="x_732">This book would not exist were it not for the efforts of
      Matt Mackall, the author and project lead of Mercurial.  He is
      ably assisted by hundreds of volunteer contributors across the
      world.</para>

    <para id="x_733">My children, Cian and Ruairi, always stood ready to help me
      to unwind with wonderful, madcap little-boy games.  I'd also
      like to thank my ex-wife, Shannon, for her support.</para>

    <para id="x_734">My colleagues and friends provided help and support in
      innumerable ways.  This list of people is necessarily very
      incomplete: Stephen Hahn, Karyn Ritter, Bonnie Corwin, James
      Vasile, Matt Norwood, Eben Moglen, Bradley Kuhn, Robert Walsh,
      Jeremy Fitzhardinge, Rachel Chalmers.</para>

    <para id="x_735">I developed this book in the open, posting drafts of
      chapters to the book web site as I completed them.  Readers then
      submitted feedback using a web application that I developed.  By
      the time I finished writing the book, more than 100 people had
      submitted comments, an amazing number considering that the
      comment system was live for only about two months towards the
      end of the writing process.</para>

    <para id="x_736">I would particularly like to recognize the following people,
      who between them contributed over a third of the total number of
      comments.  I would like to thank them for their care and effort
      in providing so much detailed feedback.</para>

    <para id="x_737">Martin Geisler, Damien Cassou, Alexey Bakhirkin, Till Plewe,
      Dan Himes, Paul Sargent, Gokberk Hamurcu, Matthijs van der
      Vleuten, Michael Chermside, John Mulligan, Jordi Fita, Jon
      Parise.</para>

    <para id="x_738">I also want to acknowledge the help of the many people who
      caught errors and provided helpful suggestions throughout the
      book.</para>
