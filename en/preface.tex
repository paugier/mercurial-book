Distributed revision control is a relatively new territory, and has
thus far grown due to people's willingness to strike out into
ill-charted territory.

I am writing a book about distributed revision control because I
believe that it is an important subject that deserves a field guide.
I chose to write about Mercurial because it is the easiest tool to
learn the terrain with, and yet it scales to the demands of real,
challenging environments where many other revision control tools fail.

\section{This book is a work in progress}

I am releasing this book while I am still writing it, in the hope that
it will prove useful to others.  I also hope that readers will
contribute as they see fit.
