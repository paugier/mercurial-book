  <h2>Welcome to Mercurial: The Definitive Guide</h2>

  <p>This is the online home of the book &#8220;Mercurial: The
    Definitive Guide&#8221;.  
    It will be published in 2009 by O'Reilly Media.</p>

  <p>I make the content <a href="/read/">freely available
      online</a>.  If you like it, please make a note to buy a copy!</p>

  <h2>You can contribute!</h2>

  <p>I publish the <a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/">source
      code</a> for this book as a Mercurial repository.  Please feel
    welcome to clone it, make modifications to your copy, and send me
    changes.</p>

  <p>The online version of the book includes a comment system
    that you can use to send feedback involving errors, omissions, and
    suggestions.</p>

  <p>(If you would like to adapt the comment system for a
    publishing project of your own, the source for the web application
    is included with the book source at the link above.)</p>

  <h2>What is Mercurial?</h2>

  <p><a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial">Mercurial</a> is a
    fast, lightweight source control management system
    designed for easy and efficient handling of very large distributed
    projects.</p>

  <h2>How I help Mercurial and free software, and you can too</h2>

  <p>Mercurial is a member of the <a href="http://conservancy.softwarefreedom.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>, a
    wonderful non-profit organisation that offers its member projects
    legal and administrative advice.</p>

  <p>I am donating my royalties from the sales of this book (once it is
    published) to the Software Freedom Conservancy, and I encourage
    you to support their work, too.</p>

  <p>The SFC can
    accept <a href="http://conservancy.softwarefreedom.org/?donate">accept
    donations</a> (tax-free under IRS 501(c)(3), within the United
    States) on behalf of its member projects. If you would like to
    support Mercurial directly, please consider making a donation to
    the SFC on its behalf.</p>

  <p>If you would like to help free software developers to provide
    their important public services without being impeded by legal
    issues, please consider donating to the SFC's sister organisation,
    the <a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/">Software Freedom Law
    Center</a>.</p>
