  <h2>Welcome to Mercurial: The Definitive Guide</h2>

  <p>This is the online home of the book &#8220;Mercurial: The

    fast, lightweight source control management system
    designed for easy and efficient handling of very large distributed
    projects.  My book tells you what it is, why you should care, and
