Build dependencies
==================

On Ubuntu, you need to run the following command to install all of the dependencies:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install \
        make \
        python \
        unzip \
        bzip2 \
        wget \
        python-dev \
        build-essential \
        python-docutils \
        rcs \
        inkscape \
        graphviz \
        python-sphinx \
        texlive-latex-base \
        texlive-latex-extra \
        pgf \
        poppler-utils \
        openssh-server

Docker build
============

As an alternative to getting all the dependencies set up properly,
you can also run 'make docker-%', with '%' being the make target.
Adding 'docker-' as prefix results in creating a Docker image
with all the dependencies you need. The book will then be built
inside that image.
