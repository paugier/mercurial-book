<title>Adding functionality with extensions</title>
<para>\label{chap:hgext}</para>

<para>While the core of Mercurial is quite complete from a functionality
standpoint, it's deliberately shorn of fancy features.  This approach
of preserving simplicity keeps the software easy to deal with for both
maintainers and users.</para>

<para>However, Mercurial doesn't box you in with an inflexible command set:
you can add features to it as <emphasis>extensions</emphasis> (sometimes known as
<emphasis>plugins</emphasis>).  We've already discussed a few of these extensions in
earlier chapters.</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Section <xref linkend="sec:tour-merge:fetch"/> covers the <literal role="hg-ext">fetch</literal>
  extension; this combines pulling new changes and merging them with
  local changes into a single command, <command role="hg-ext-fetch">fetch</command>.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>In chapter <xref linkend="chap:hook"/>, we covered several extensions that
  are useful for hook-related functionality: <literal role="hg-ext">acl</literal> adds access
  control lists; <literal role="hg-ext">bugzilla</literal> adds integration with the Bugzilla
  bug tracking system; and <literal role="hg-ext">notify</literal> sends notification emails on
  new changes.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>The Mercurial Queues patch management extension is so invaluable
  that it merits two chapters and an appendix all to itself.
  Chapter <xref linkend="chap:mq"/> covers the basics;
  chapter <xref linkend="chap:mq-collab"/> discusses advanced topics; and
  appendix <xref linkend="chap:mqref"/> goes into detail on each command.</para>
</listitem></itemizedlist>

<para>In this chapter, we'll cover some of the other extensions that are
available for Mercurial, and briefly touch on some of the machinery
you'll need to know about if you want to write an extension of your
own.</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>In section <xref linkend="sec:hgext:inotify"/>, we'll discuss the
  possibility of <emphasis>huge</emphasis> performance improvements using the
  <literal role="hg-ext">inotify</literal> extension.</para>
</listitem></itemizedlist>

<sect1>
<title>Improve performance with the <literal role="hg-ext">inotify</literal> extension</title>
<para>\label{sec:hgext:inotify}
</para>

<para>Are you interested in having some of the most common Mercurial
operations run as much as a hundred times faster?  Read on!
</para>

<para>Mercurial has great performance under normal circumstances.  For
example, when you run the <command role="hg-cmd">hg status</command> command, Mercurial has to
scan almost every directory and file in your repository so that it can
display file status.  Many other Mercurial commands need to do the
same work behind the scenes; for example, the <command role="hg-cmd">hg diff</command> command
uses the status machinery to avoid doing an expensive comparison
operation on files that obviously haven't changed.
</para>

<para>Because obtaining file status is crucial to good performance, the
authors of Mercurial have optimised this code to within an inch of its
life.  However, there's no avoiding the fact that when you run
<command role="hg-cmd">hg status</command>, Mercurial is going to have to perform at least one
expensive system call for each managed file to determine whether it's
changed since the last time Mercurial checked.  For a sufficiently
large repository, this can take a long time.
</para>

<para>To put a number on the magnitude of this effect, I created a
repository containing 150,000 managed files.  I timed <command role="hg-cmd">hg status</command>
as taking ten seconds to run, even when <emphasis>none</emphasis> of those files had
been modified.
</para>

<para>Many modern operating systems contain a file notification facility.
If a program signs up to an appropriate service, the operating system
will notify it every time a file of interest is created, modified, or
deleted.  On Linux systems, the kernel component that does this is
called <literal>inotify</literal>.
</para>

<para>Mercurial's <literal role="hg-ext">inotify</literal> extension talks to the kernel's
<literal>inotify</literal> component to optimise <command role="hg-cmd">hg status</command> commands.  The
extension has two components.  A daemon sits in the background and
receives notifications from the <literal>inotify</literal> subsystem.  It also
listens for connections from a regular Mercurial command.  The
extension modifies Mercurial's behaviour so that instead of scanning
the filesystem, it queries the daemon.  Since the daemon has perfect
information about the state of the repository, it can respond with a
result instantaneously, avoiding the need to scan every directory and
file in the repository.
</para>

<para>Recall the ten seconds that I measured plain Mercurial as taking to
run <command role="hg-cmd">hg status</command> on a 150,000 file repository.  With the
<literal role="hg-ext">inotify</literal> extension enabled, the time dropped to 0.1 seconds, a
factor of <emphasis>one hundred</emphasis> faster.
</para>

<para>Before we continue, please pay attention to some caveats.
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The <literal role="hg-ext">inotify</literal> extension is Linux-specific.  Because it
  interfaces directly to the Linux kernel's <literal>inotify</literal>
  subsystem, it does not work on other operating systems.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>It should work on any Linux distribution that was released after
  early 2005.  Older distributions are likely to have a kernel that
  lacks <literal>inotify</literal>, or a version of <literal>glibc</literal> that does not
  have the necessary interfacing support.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Not all filesystems are suitable for use with the
  <literal role="hg-ext">inotify</literal> extension.  Network filesystems such as NFS are a
  non-starter, for example, particularly if you're running Mercurial
  on several systems, all mounting the same network filesystem.  The
  kernel's <literal>inotify</literal> system has no way of knowing about changes
  made on another system.  Most local filesystems (e.g. ext3, XFS,
  ReiserFS) should work fine.
</para>
</listitem></itemizedlist>

<para>The <literal role="hg-ext">inotify</literal> extension is not yet shipped with Mercurial as of
May 2007, so it's a little more involved to set up than other
extensions.  But the performance improvement is worth it!
</para>

<para>The extension currently comes in two parts: a set of patches to the
Mercurial source code, and a library of Python bindings to the
<literal>inotify</literal> subsystem.
</para>
<note>
<para>  There are <emphasis>two</emphasis> Python <literal>inotify</literal> binding libraries.  One
  of them is called <literal>pyinotify</literal>, and is packaged by some Linux
  distributions as <literal>python-inotify</literal>.  This is <emphasis>not</emphasis> the
  one you'll need, as it is too buggy and inefficient to be practical.
</para>
</note>
<para>To get going, it's best to already have a functioning copy of
Mercurial installed.
</para>
<note>
<para>  If you follow the instructions below, you'll be <emphasis>replacing</emphasis> and
  overwriting any existing installation of Mercurial that you might
  already have, using the latest <quote>bleeding edge</quote> Mercurial code.
  Don't say you weren't warned!

<para>Once you've build a suitably patched version of Mercurial, all you

</para>
<programlisting>
<para>  [extensions]

</para>
</programlisting>
<para>When the <literal role="hg-ext">inotify</literal> extension is enabled, Mercurial will
automatically and transparently start the status daemon the first time
you run a command that needs status in a repository.  It runs one
status daemon per repository.
</para>

<para>The status daemon is started silently, and runs in the background.  If
you look at a list of running processes after you've enabled the
<literal role="hg-ext">inotify</literal> extension and run a few commands in different
repositories, you'll thus see a few <literal>hg</literal> processes sitting
around, waiting for updates from the kernel and queries from
Mercurial.
</para>

<para>The first time you run a Mercurial command in a repository when you
have the <literal role="hg-ext">inotify</literal> extension enabled, it will run with about the
same performance as a normal Mercurial command.  This is because the
status daemon needs to perform a normal status scan so that it has a
baseline against which to apply later updates from the kernel.
However, <emphasis>every</emphasis> subsequent command that does any kind of status
check should be noticeably faster on repositories of even fairly
modest size.  Better yet, the bigger your repository is, the greater a
performance advantage you'll see.  The <literal role="hg-ext">inotify</literal> daemon makes
status operations almost instantaneous on repositories of all sizes!
</para>

<para>If you like, you can manually start a status daemon using the
<command role="hg-ext-inotify">inserve</command> command.  This gives you slightly finer
control over how the daemon ought to run.  This command will of course
only be available when the <literal role="hg-ext">inotify</literal> extension is enabled.
</para>

<para>When you're using the <literal role="hg-ext">inotify</literal> extension, you should notice
<emphasis>no difference at all</emphasis> in Mercurial's behaviour, with the sole
exception of status-related commands running a whole lot faster than
they used to.  You should specifically expect that commands will not
print different output; neither should they give different results.
If either of these situations occurs, please report a bug.

<title>Flexible diff support with the <literal role="hg-ext">extdiff</literal> extension</title>
<para>\label{sec:hgext:extdiff}
</para>

<para>Mercurial's built-in <command role="hg-cmd">hg diff</command> command outputs plaintext unified
diffs.
<!-- &interaction.extdiff.diff; -->
If you would like to use an external tool to display modifications,
you'll want to use the <literal role="hg-ext">extdiff</literal> extension.  This will let you
use, for example, a graphical diff tool.
</para>

<para>The <literal role="hg-ext">extdiff</literal> extension is bundled with Mercurial, so it's easy
to set up.  In the <literal role="rc-extensions">extensions</literal> section of your <filename role="special"> /.hgrc</filename>,
simply add a one-line entry to enable the extension.
</para>
<programlisting>
<para>  [extensions]
  extdiff =
</para>
</programlisting>
<para>This introduces a command named <command role="hg-ext-extdiff">extdiff</command>, which by
default uses your system's <command>diff</command> command to generate a
unified diff in the same form as the built-in <command role="hg-cmd">hg diff</command> command.
<!-- &interaction.extdiff.extdiff; -->
The result won't be exactly the same as with the built-in <command role="hg-cmd">hg diff</command>
variations, because the output of <command>diff</command> varies from one
system to another, even when passed the same options.
</para>

<para>As the <quote><literal>making snapshot</literal></quote> lines of output above imply, the
<command role="hg-ext-extdiff">extdiff</command> command works by creating two snapshots of
your source tree.  The first snapshot is of the source revision; the
second, of the target revision or working directory.  The
<command role="hg-ext-extdiff">extdiff</command> command generates these snapshots in a
temporary directory, passes the name of each directory to an external
diff viewer, then deletes the temporary directory.  For efficiency, it
only snapshots the directories and files that have changed between the
two revisions.
</para>

<para>Snapshot directory names have the same base name as your repository.
If your repository path is <filename class="directory">/quux/bar/foo</filename>, then <filename class="directory">foo</filename>
will be the name of each snapshot directory.  Each snapshot directory
name has its changeset ID appended, if appropriate.  If a snapshot is
of revision <literal>a631aca1083f</literal>, the directory will be named
<filename class="directory">foo.a631aca1083f</filename>.  A snapshot of the working directory won't
have a changeset ID appended, so it would just be <filename class="directory">foo</filename> in
this example.  To see what this looks like in practice, look again at
the <command role="hg-ext-extdiff">extdiff</command> example above.  Notice that the diff has
the snapshot directory names embedded in its header.
</para>

<para>The <command role="hg-ext-extdiff">extdiff</command> command accepts two important options.
The <option role="hg-ext-extdiff-cmd-extdiff-opt">-p</option> option lets you choose a program to
view differences with, instead of <command>diff</command>.  With the
<option role="hg-ext-extdiff-cmd-extdiff-opt">-o</option> option, you can change the options that
<command role="hg-ext-extdiff">extdiff</command> passes to the program (by default, these
options are <quote><literal>-Npru</literal></quote>, which only make sense if you're
running <command>diff</command>).  In other respects, the
<command role="hg-ext-extdiff">extdiff</command> command acts similarly to the built-in
<command role="hg-cmd">hg diff</command> command: you use the same option names, syntax, and
arguments to specify the revisions you want, the files you want, and
so on.
</para>

<para>As an example, here's how to run the normal system <command>diff</command>
command, getting it to generate context diffs (using the
<option role="cmd-opt-diff">-c</option> option) instead of unified diffs, and five lines of
context instead of the default three (passing <literal>5</literal> as the
argument to the <option role="cmd-opt-diff">-C</option> option).
<!-- &interaction.extdiff.extdiff-ctx; -->
</para>

<para>Launching a visual diff tool is just as easy.  Here's how to launch
the <command>kdiff3</command> viewer.
</para>
<programlisting>
<para>  hg extdiff -p kdiff3 -o </quote>
</para>
</programlisting>

<para>If your diff viewing command can't deal with directories, you can
easily work around this with a little scripting.  For an example of
such scripting in action with the <literal role="hg-ext">mq</literal> extension and the
<command>interdiff</command> command, see
section <xref linkend="mq-collab:tips:interdiff"/>.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Defining command aliases</title>

<para>It can be cumbersome to remember the options to both the
<command role="hg-ext-extdiff">extdiff</command> command and the diff viewer you want to use,
so the <literal role="hg-ext">extdiff</literal> extension lets you define <emphasis>new</emphasis> commands
that will invoke your diff viewer with exactly the right options.
</para>

<para>All you need to do is edit your <filename role="special"> /.hgrc</filename>, and add a section named
<literal role="rc-extdiff">extdiff</literal>.  Inside this section, you can define multiple
commands.  Here's how to add a <literal>kdiff3</literal> command.  Once you've
defined this, you can type <quote><literal>hg kdiff3</literal></quote> and the
<literal role="hg-ext">extdiff</literal> extension will run <command>kdiff3</command> for you.
</para>
<programlisting>
<para>  [extdiff]
  cmd.kdiff3 =
</para>
</programlisting>
<para>If you leave the right hand side of the definition empty, as above,
the <literal role="hg-ext">extdiff</literal> extension uses the name of the command you defined
as the name of the external program to run.  But these names don't
have to be the same.  Here, we define a command named <quote>\texttt{hg
  wibble}</quote>, which runs <command>kdiff3</command>.
</para>
<programlisting>
<para>  [extdiff]
  cmd.wibble = kdiff3
</para>
</programlisting>

<para>You can also specify the default options that you want to invoke your
diff viewing program with.  The prefix to use is <quote><literal>opts.</literal></quote>,
followed by the name of the command to which the options apply.  This
example defines a <quote><literal>hg vimdiff</literal></quote> command that runs the
<command>vim</command> editor's <literal>DirDiff</literal> extension.
</para>
<programlisting>
<para>  [extdiff]
  cmd.vimdiff = vim
  opts.vimdiff = -f '+next' '+execute "DirDiff" argv(0) argv(1)'
</para>

<title>Send changes via email with the <literal role="hg-ext">patchbomb</literal> extension</title>
<para>\label{sec:hgext:patchbomb}
</para>

<para>Many projects have a culture of <quote>change review</quote>, in which people
send their modifications to a mailing list for others to read and
comment on before they commit the final version to a shared
repository.  Some projects have people who act as gatekeepers; they
apply changes from other people to a repository to which those others
don't have access.
</para>

<para>Mercurial makes it easy to send changes over email for review or
application, via its <literal role="hg-ext">patchbomb</literal> extension.  The extension is so
namd because changes are formatted as patches, and it's usual to send
one changeset per email message.  Sending a long series of changes by
email is thus much like <quote>bombing</quote> the recipient's inbox, hence
<quote>patchbomb</quote>.
</para>

<para>As usual, the basic configuration of the <literal role="hg-ext">patchbomb</literal> extension
takes just one or two lines in your <filename role="special"> /.hgrc</filename>.
</para>
<programlisting>
<para>  [extensions]
  patchbomb =
</para>
</programlisting>
<para>Once you've enabled the extension, you will have a new command
available, named <command role="hg-ext-patchbomb">email</command>.
</para>

<para>The safest and best way to invoke the <command role="hg-ext-patchbomb">email</command>
command is to <emphasis>always</emphasis> run it first with the
<option role="hg-ext-patchbomb-cmd-email-opt">-n</option> option.  This will show you what the
command <emphasis>would</emphasis> send, without actually sending anything.  Once
you've had a quick glance over the changes and verified that you are
sending the right ones, you can rerun the same command, with the
<option role="hg-ext-patchbomb-cmd-email-opt">-n</option> option removed.
</para>

<para>The <command role="hg-ext-patchbomb">email</command> command accepts the same kind of
revision syntax as every other Mercurial command.  For example, this
command will send every revision between 7 and <literal>tip</literal>,
inclusive.
</para>
<programlisting>
<para>  hg email -n 7:tip
</para>
</programlisting>
<para>You can also specify a <emphasis>repository</emphasis> to compare with.  If you
provide a repository but no revisions, the <command role="hg-ext-patchbomb">email</command>
command will send all revisions in the local repository that are not
present in the remote repository.  If you additionally specify
revisions or a branch name (the latter using the
<option role="hg-ext-patchbomb-cmd-email-opt">-b</option> option), this will constrain the
revisions sent.
</para>

<para>It's perfectly safe to run the <command role="hg-ext-patchbomb">email</command> command
without the names of the people you want to send to: if you do this,
it will just prompt you for those values interactively.  (If you're
using a Linux or Unix-like system, you should have enhanced
<literal>readline</literal>-style editing capabilities when entering those
headers, too, which is useful.)
</para>

<para>When you are sending just one revision, the <command role="hg-ext-patchbomb">email</command>
command will by default use the first line of the changeset
description as the subject of the single email message it sends.
</para>

<para>If you send multiple revisions, the <command role="hg-ext-patchbomb">email</command> command
will usually send one message per changeset.  It will preface the
series with an introductory message, in which you should describe the
purpose of the series of changes you're sending.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Changing the behaviour of patchbombs</title>

<para>Not every project has exactly the same conventions for sending changes
in email; the <literal role="hg-ext">patchbomb</literal> extension tries to accommodate a
number of variations through command line options.
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>You can write a subject for the introductory message on the
  command line using the <option role="hg-ext-patchbomb-cmd-email-opt">-s</option> option.  This
  takes one argument, the text of the subject to use.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>To change the email address from which the messages originate,
  use the <option role="hg-ext-patchbomb-cmd-email-opt">-f</option> option.  This takes one
  argument, the email address to use.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>The default behaviour is to send unified diffs (see
  section <xref linkend="sec:mq:patch"/> for a description of the format), one per
  message.  You can send a binary bundle instead with the
  <option role="hg-ext-patchbomb-cmd-email-opt">-b</option> option.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Unified diffs are normally prefaced with a metadata header.  You
  can omit this, and send unadorned diffs, with the
  <option role="hg-ext-patchbomb-cmd-email-opt">--plain</option> option.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Diffs are normally sent <quote>inline</quote>, in the same body part as the
  description of a patch.  This makes it easiest for the largest
  number of readers to quote and respond to parts of a diff, as some
  mail clients will only quote the first MIME body part in a message.
  If you'd prefer to send the description and the diff in separate
  body parts, use the <option role="hg-ext-patchbomb-cmd-email-opt">-a</option> option.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Instead of sending mail messages, you can write them to an
  <literal>mbox</literal>-format mail folder using the
  <option role="hg-ext-patchbomb-cmd-email-opt">-m</option> option.  That option takes one
  argument, the name of the file to write to.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>If you would like to add a <command>diffstat</command>-format summary to
  each patch, and one to the introductory message, use the
  <option role="hg-ext-patchbomb-cmd-email-opt">-d</option> option.  The <command>diffstat</command>
  command displays a table containing the name of each file patched,
  the number of lines affected, and a histogram showing how much each
  file is modified.  This gives readers a qualitative glance at how
  complex a patch is.
